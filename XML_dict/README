The licensing statement releases the contents of the 
dictionary by Tadeusz Piotrowski and Zygmunt Saloni 
under GNU GPL 2.0 or later and [the intention, I 
believe, was OR] GNU GFDL 1.2 or later, in the form 
of:
* TeX by the Authors, 
* SGML by (possibly among others) Katarzyna Głowińska 
  and Marcin Woliński, and
* TEI P4 XML (which is not the TEI of the FreeDict 
  project but an earlier conversion, not provided by FreeDict).

This very package contains XML-ised SGML with IPA codes and UTF-8 
that served as the basis for conversion to TEI XML in the FreeDict 
project. It also contains some minor modifications described in the 
notes.txt file and a list of entries lost in the TeX-to-SGML conversion.
